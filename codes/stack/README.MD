# Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements.

## Order

* __LIFO__ - Last In First Out

## Pricipal operations

* __Push__ - adds an element to the collection
* __Pop__ - removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed

### Extended

* __peek__ - give access to the top element without modifying the stack.
