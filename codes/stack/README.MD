# Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements

## Pricipal operations

* __Push__ - which adds an element to the collection
* __Pop__ - which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, __LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)__. A __peek__ operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
