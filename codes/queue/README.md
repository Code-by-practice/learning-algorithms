# Queue

A queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order.

## Order

* __FIFO__ - First In First Out

## Principle operations

* __enqueue__ - adds element to the rear position
* __dequeue__ removes element from the front position

## Types

* __Circular Queue__

  Also knows as circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer. A data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.

* __Double-ended Queue__

  A double-ended queue (deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail). It is also often called a head-tail linked list.

* __Priority Queue__

  A priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it.

  In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
