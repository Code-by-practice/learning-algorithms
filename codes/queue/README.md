# Queue

A queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order.

## Principle operations

* __enqueue__ - Addtion of entities to the rear position
* __dequeue__ Removal of entities from the front position

This makes the queue a __FIFO (First-In-First-Out)__ data structure
